Exercise 9.1
a.) How many API endpoints does this application support and where are they implemented?
	There are 3 endpoints and they are implemented in Player, players, and players/id.

b.) PlayerResource.java
i.) What is the Java-based technology used to access data from a database?
	Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
ii.) Compare and contrast the following:
1.) SQL query statements vs. JDBC statement objects
	 SQL query statements are specific queries submitted to a database while JDBC statements objects help you to 	send SQL commands and receive data from your database. 
2.) SQL relations vs. JDBC result sets vs. List<Player>
	SQL relations are represented by tables, where each row of a table represents a single tuple, and where the 		values of each attribute form a column. JDBC results sets are subsets of the overall table, and have their 	own Class representation in Java. List<Player> is basically a list of entries with fields of data that you 		build a Player object from.
iii.) Under what circumstances would the function getValueStringOrNull() be used?
	The function getValueStringorNull() will be used when you want to provide syntax for an SQL Query and want 	the "NULL" to have no quotes.
c.) Player.java
i.) What purpose does this Player DAO serve?
	The Player DAO allows us to represent and manipulate Player in our Object-oriented world of Java.
ii.) How does it compare with the Player table?
	It seems similar because it has the same fields ie name, id and emailAddress.
